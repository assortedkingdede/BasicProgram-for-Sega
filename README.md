# BasicProgram-for-Sega
Simple image demo made with BasiEgaXorz IDE
With the final program you need two sound files of your choice, one for the menu and one for the demo. After that you need to generate a cue file using Sega Cue File Generator. This program will run on a emulator such as KEGA and GENS Kmod. This will also work on a actual Sega CD (I tested it myself)
